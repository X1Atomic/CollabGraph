### Transfer Learning of the Erdos Collaboration Graph
Developing a collaboration graph to study the parameters which dictate a paperâ€™s influence research of the same time as well as future research. This is being done by using weighted and unweighted adjacency matrices with the Erdos1 data in hopes to use other data sets from unrelated, non-academic fields: music production, quantum entanglement, art development, etc.
